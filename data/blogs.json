    "content": "# Introduction\nSQL (Structured Query Language) is the backbone of relational database management. Every engineer working with data should master SQL for querying, manipulating, and managing data.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- **SELECT**: Retrieve data from tables\n- **JOIN**: Combine data from multiple tables\n- **GROUP BY**: Aggregate data\n\n## Example: Employee Database Query\nRetrieve the names of employees and their department names:\n\n```sql\nSELECT e.name, d.department_name\nFROM employees AS e\nJOIN departments AS d ON e.department_id = d.id\nWHERE e.salary > 50000\nORDER BY e.name;\n```\n\nThis query demonstrates combining tables, filtering results, and ordering them.\n\n## Best Practices\n- Always use explicit joins for clarity\n- Avoid `SELECT *` in production queries\n- Index important columns for performance\n\nSQL skills empower engineers to efficiently access and analyze large datasets."

    "content": "# Introduction\nNL2SQL is a fascinating application of NLP (Natural Language Processing) where users write **natural language queries**, and a model converts them into SQL statements automatically.\n\n## How NL2SQL Works\n1. **Input Processing**: Tokenize user input and understand intent.\n2. **Semantic Mapping**: Map natural language entities to database schema.\n3. **SQL Generation**: Construct syntactically correct SQL statements.\n\n## Example\nNatural language query:\n```\nList the names of employees in the Sales department earning more than $50,000\n```\nGenerated SQL:\n```sql\nSELECT name\nFROM employees\nWHERE department = 'Sales' AND salary > 50000;\n```\n\n## Using Transformer Models\nLarge language models like CodeT5 or GPT variants can be fine-tuned on NL2SQL datasets to perform this mapping.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('Salesforce/codet5-base')\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained('path_to_your_finetuned_model')\n\nnl_query = 'List all employees in Marketing earning above 60000'\ninputs = tokenizer(nl_query, return_tensors='pt')\noutputs = model.generate(**inputs)\nsql_query = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\nprint(sql_query)\n```\n\nNL2SQL enables non-technical users to query databases easily and demonstrates the power of AI in education and data accessibility."
